# mvc-tech-blog

##Description
---
This project uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure to build a website similar to Wordpress. This is a place where developers can publish blog posts, as well as comment on other blog posts. To begin a User signs up for an account. They are able to then login, go to their dashboard to view all of their blog posts, comment on others blog posts, edit their posts, and delete their posts. This was created with multiple node packages including, espress-handlebars, MySQL2, Sequalize, dotenv, bcrypt, espress-session, and connect-session-sequalize.
